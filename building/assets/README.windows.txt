Areca Backup
============

Areca requires Java JRE (recommended) or JDK in order to work.
Areca will use the first Java installations it finds following this priority sequence:

1. "jdk" (within Areca folder)
2. "jre" (within Areca folder)
3. "JAVA_HOME"
4. Standard Java installation

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
JDK: Java Development Kit
