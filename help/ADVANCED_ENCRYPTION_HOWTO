To enable advanced encryption (such as AES 256) :

The unlimited policy files are required only for JDK 8, 7, and 6 updates earlier than 8u161, 7u171, and 6u181.
On those versions and later, the stronger cryptographic algorithms are available by default. See:
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jce-all-downloads.html

* If you are running Java version 6 or older : 
Locate the "local_policy.jar" file in your {java_home}/lib/security directory, rename it and replace it by the "local_policy.jar" which is contained in the {areca_home}/lib directory.
You can alternatively download the version provided by Sun : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-6-download-429243.html

* If you are running Java version 7 or later : 
Use the local policy file that is located here : http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html
